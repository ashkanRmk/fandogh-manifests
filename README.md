## Contribution Structure
As you know, [Fandogh PaaS](https://fandogh.cloud) is highly active in open source projects and communities and this repository is open source too.\
You can contribute and share your fandogh manifests with other users to provide ease and joy.

### Steps
1) Create a [manifest](https://docs.fandogh.cloud/docs/service-manifest.html) and test it with [fandogh-cli](https://docs.fandogh.cloud/docs/getting-started.html)
2) After successful deployment, make a fork.
3) Make a folder with service name
4) Create a README.md file, with brief description about the service that you provided its manifest and its config.
5) Remove real values and credentials from manifest and replace them with general value like -> name: SERVICE_NAME
6) Put the manifest in created folder
7) Create merge request and we will be happy to accept :)
