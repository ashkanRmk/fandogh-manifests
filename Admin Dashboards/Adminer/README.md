# Adminer
`Adminer` (formerly known as phpMinAdmin) is a tool for managing content in **MySQL** databases (since version 2 also in **PostgreSQL**, **MS SQL**, **SQLite** and Oracle databases). Adminer is distributed under Apache license (or GPL v2) in a form of a single PHP file (around 470 KiB in size). Its author is Jakub VrÃ¡na who started to develop this tool as a light-weight alternative to phpMyAdmin, in July 2007.\
Adminer got some attention in 2008 when it made it to the CCA finals at SourceForge.[2] Also, first webhosting providers started to include Adminer as MySQL managing tool into their portfolio of services. In 2012 Adminer got coverage on Linux.com for the second time.[3] The project's priorities, according to its author, are (in this order): safety, user-friendliness, performance, functionality, and size.
